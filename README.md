## CHILDREN ANEMIC
This project endeavors to elucidate the complex interplay between mothers age, socio-economic status, and among other variables on the incidence of anemia among Nigerian children aged 0-59 months. Using a dataset that encompasses responses from mothers from age  15 to 49 across the 36 states in Nigeria and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), this analysis aims not only to highlight key contributing factors to childhood anemia but also to develop predictive models that can inform targeted interventions.

**Key Findings** 

- It is observed that Hemoglobin level is an important factor that must be considered to affect the child's anemic condition. Understanding the need for good nutrition is a way to help prevent anemic condition 
- Mother's Age at which the mother gave birth to her first child is associated with the anemic condition in child, the older the mother the lower the chances of having a child with Anemia
- The dataset suggest a correlation between the socio-economic status of the family and anemia in children, with lower-income households showing positive association with Anemia

**Methodology**
This project leverages statistical analysis and machine learning models such as Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbor and Logistic Regression to investigate the dataset. 

Data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA) were conducted to identify patterns and correlations. 

Finally, predictive modeling is employed to assess the influence of various factors on anemia in children. 
The models are evaluated based on their accuracy, precision, and recall.

**Conclusion**
This project aims to pave way for predictive modeling, targeted interventions, and contribute to the broader endeavor of safeguarding children's health and well-being.
